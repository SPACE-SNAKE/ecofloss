# EcoFloss - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Executive Summary

EcoFloss is a revolutionary e-commerce platform addressing humanity's #1 source of daily microplastic intake through bamboo-based oral care products. The platform combines health-focused messaging around microplastics reduction with environmental conservation impact, creating a truly symbiotic relationship between human health and planetary wellness.

## Core Mission Statement

"EcoFloss eliminates your daily microplastic intake while creating a symbiotic relationship with nature. Every bamboo product you purchase makes you healthier by reducing plastic ingestion and helps reforest bamboo habitats for pandas - it's the ultimate win-win for human health and environmental conservation."

## Market Problem & Opportunity

### The Microplastics Health Crisis
- **Critical Statistic**: 99% of males globally have microplastics in their testicles
- **Primary Intake Source**: Daily toothbrushing with plastic toothbrushes and dental floss
- **Health Impact**: Dental floss directly scrapes gums, providing direct bloodstream access for microplastics
- **Scale**: Billions of people perform this plastic-ingesting activity 1-2 times daily

### Environmental Problem
- Plastic toothbrushes and dental floss are among the most frequently discarded items globally
- Short product lifecycle (3-4 months for toothbrushes, weeks for floss)
- Major contributors to ocean and forest pollution
- Non-biodegradable materials persist in ecosystems for centuries

### Market Gap
- People switching to bamboo toothbrushes but still using plastic floss
- No comprehensive solution addressing both products simultaneously
- Limited awareness of dental floss as primary microplastic source
- No existing platforms combining health benefits with conservation impact
